The easiest code to understand is the [Final Draft](/BIM_280_Final_Project_Final_Draft.ipynb). It has a beginning example section for illustrating how the MNE methods work and unused code has been deleted.

The 'Final Draft' ONLY uses code that can be found in [Draft 7](/BIM_280_Final_Project_draft_7.ipynb) or [Draft 6](/BIM_280_Final_Project_draft_6.ipynb), but they contain large amounts of messy exploratory code. The only cell reverted to 'Draft 6' is the one defining the power calculation functions.

We attempted to implement spectral flattening using 'specparam' in the power calculations of 'Draft 7,' but ultimately decided we did not have sufficient time to address the errors we were encountering.
